### Course Description:
This course provides a comprehensive introduction to database management systems. Students will learn the fundamental concepts of database design, including entity-relationship modeling, relational algebra, and database normalization. The course covers SQL for data definition, manipulation, and querying. Students will also gain practical experience in designing and implementing database systems through hands-on projects and assignments. Transaction management and concurrency control will also be discussed.

### Prerequisites:
CS201 (Data Structures and Algorithms)

### Learning Objectives:
1.  Design relational database schemas using entity-relationship modeling.
2.  Formulate queries using relational algebra.
3.  Implement and manage databases using SQL.
4.  Apply database normalization techniques to eliminate redundancy and improve data integrity.
5.  Understand and implement transaction management and concurrency control mechanisms.
6.  Develop database applications using a database management system.
