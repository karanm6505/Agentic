### Course Description:
This course provides a comprehensive introduction to the fundamental principles of software engineering. Students will learn about the entire software development life cycle, from initial requirements gathering to system deployment and maintenance. Key topics include requirements engineering, software design methodologies, design patterns, testing strategies, and project management techniques. Emphasis will be placed on practical application through group projects and hands-on exercises.

The course aims to equip students with the knowledge and skills necessary to develop high-quality, reliable, and maintainable software systems. Students will gain experience working in teams, managing project timelines, and adhering to industry best practices.

### Prerequisites:
CS201 (Data Structures and Algorithms)

### Learning Objectives:
1.  Analyze software requirements and create appropriate specifications.
2.  Apply different software design methodologies to solve complex problems.
3.  Implement common design patterns in software development.
