### Course Description:
This course provides a comprehensive introduction to the principles and practices of computer architecture and organization. Students will explore the fundamental building blocks of computer systems, including the central processing unit (CPU), memory systems, input/output (I/O) devices, and interconnections. The course emphasizes quantitative evaluation of computer performance and the impact of architectural choices on overall system efficiency. Students will gain hands-on experience through design projects and simulations, reinforcing their understanding of key concepts.

The course covers instruction set architecture (ISA), pipelining, memory hierarchy design, cache memory, virtual memory, storage, and I/O systems. Advanced topics such as parallel processing and multicore architectures will also be introduced. Students will learn to analyze and evaluate different architectural designs, considering factors such as performance, cost, and power consumption.
