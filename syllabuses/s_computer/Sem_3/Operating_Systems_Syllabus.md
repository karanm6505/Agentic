### Course Description:
This course provides a comprehensive introduction to the fundamental concepts underlying modern operating systems. Students will explore process management, memory management, file systems, input/output systems, and concurrency. Through lectures, programming assignments, and simulations, students will gain practical experience in designing and implementing operating system components. The course emphasizes both theoretical understanding and hands-on application of operating system principles.

### Prerequisites:
Data Structures, Computer Architecture

### Learning Objectives:
1.  Explain the fundamental concepts and architecture of operating systems.
2.  Implement process management techniques, including scheduling and synchronization.
3.  Analyze different memory management strategies, such as virtual memory and paging.
4.  Design and implement file systems, including file organization and access methods.
5.  Evaluate concurrency control mechanisms and their impact on system performance.
6.  Simulate operating system functionalities using programming tools and techniques.
