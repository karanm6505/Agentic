### Course Description:
This course provides a comprehensive introduction to the design and analysis of algorithms. Students will learn fundamental algorithm design techniques, including divide-and-conquer, dynamic programming, and greedy algorithms. Emphasis will be placed on analyzing the time and space complexity of algorithms and proving their correctness. Students will also gain practical experience in implementing and evaluating algorithms through programming assignments and projects.

The course covers asymptotic notations, recurrence relations, sorting and searching algorithms, graph algorithms, and NP-completeness. Students will develop problem-solving skills and learn to choose the most appropriate algorithm for a given task.
