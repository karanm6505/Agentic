### Course Description:
This course provides a comprehensive introduction to the fundamental mathematical concepts essential for computer science. Topics include propositional and predicate logic, set theory, relations, functions, combinatorics, and graph theory. Emphasis will be placed on applying these mathematical tools to solve problems in computer science, such as algorithm analysis, data structure design, and cryptography. Students will develop their ability to think abstractly, solve problems rigorously, and communicate mathematical ideas effectively.

### Prerequisites:
None

### Learning Objectives:
1.  Apply propositional and predicate logic to formalize arguments and analyze program correctness.
2.  Utilize set theory, relations, and functions to model computational structures and data types.
3.  Solve counting problems using combinatorial techniques, including permutations, combinations, and recurrence relations.
4.  Employ graph theory to represent and analyze networks, algorithms, and data structures.
5.  Construct mathematical proofs using various techniques, such as direct proof, proof by contradiction, and induction.
6.  Relate discrete mathematical concepts to practical applications in computer science.
