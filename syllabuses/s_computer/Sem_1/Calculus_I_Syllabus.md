### Course Description:
This course provides an introduction to single-variable calculus, focusing on limits, derivatives, and integrals. Students will develop a strong foundation in the fundamental concepts and techniques of calculus and their applications, particularly in engineering contexts. Topics include functions, limits, continuity, differentiation, applications of derivatives, integration, and the fundamental theorem of calculus.

### Prerequisites:
High school algebra, trigonometry

### Learning Objectives:
1.  Calculate limits of functions using algebraic techniques and limit laws.
2.  Compute derivatives of various functions, including polynomial, trigonometric, exponential, and logarithmic functions, using differentiation rules.
3.  Apply derivatives to solve optimization problems, related rates problems, and analyze the behavior of functions.
4.  Evaluate definite and indefinite integrals using various integration techniques.
5.  Apply the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus to relate differentiation and integration.
6.  Model and solve engineering problems using calculus concepts.
