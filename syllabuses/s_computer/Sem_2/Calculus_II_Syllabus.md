### Course Description:
This course is a continuation of Calculus I, focusing on techniques of integration, applications of integral calculus, and an introduction to sequences and series. Students will develop a strong understanding of advanced integration methods, learn to apply integration to solve problems in geometry and physics, and gain a solid foundation in the theory of sequences and series, including convergence tests and power series representations.

### Prerequisites:
Calculus I (MATH 101)

### Learning Objectives:
1.  Apply various techniques of integration, including substitution, integration by parts, trigonometric integrals, trigonometric substitution, and partial fractions.
2.  Utilize definite integrals to calculate areas, volumes, arc lengths, and surface areas.
3.  Model and solve applied problems involving integration, such as work, fluid force, and average values.
4.  Determine the convergence or divergence of sequences and series using appropriate tests, including the integral test, comparison tests, ratio test, and root test.
5.  Represent functions as power series, including Taylor and Maclaurin series, and use these representations to solve problems.
6.  Evaluate improper integrals and understand their convergence properties.
