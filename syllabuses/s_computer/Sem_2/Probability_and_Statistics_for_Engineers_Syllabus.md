### Course Description:
This course provides an introduction to probability and statistics with a focus on applications in engineering. Students will learn the fundamental concepts of probability theory, random variables, common probability distributions, and statistical inference. Topics include descriptive statistics, hypothesis testing, confidence intervals, and regression analysis. Emphasis will be placed on applying these concepts to solve real-world engineering problems.

### Prerequisites:
Calculus I, Calculus II

### Learning Objectives:
1.  Apply basic probability principles to solve engineering problems.
2.  Calculate probabilities and expected values for discrete and continuous random variables.
3.  Identify and utilize appropriate probability distributions for modeling engineering data.
4.  Construct confidence intervals and perform hypothesis tests for engineering parameters.
5.  Apply regression analysis to model relationships between variables in engineering systems.
6.  Use statistical software to analyze engineering data and interpret results.
