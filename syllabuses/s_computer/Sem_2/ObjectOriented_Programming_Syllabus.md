### Course Description:
This course provides a comprehensive introduction to the principles and practices of object-oriented programming (OOP). Students will learn fundamental OOP concepts such as encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism, and apply these concepts using a modern programming language like Java. The course emphasizes hands-on experience through coding projects that reinforce theoretical knowledge and develop problem-solving skills. Students will also gain proficiency in designing and implementing object-oriented solutions to real-world problems.

### Prerequisites:
Introduction to Programming or equivalent

### Learning Objectives:
1.  Explain the core principles of object-oriented programming, including encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.
2.  Design and implement classes and objects using a modern programming language like Java.
3.  Apply object-oriented design principles to solve real-world problems.
4.  Utilize inheritance and polymorphism to create reusable and maintainable code.
5.  Implement interfaces and abstract classes to achieve abstraction.
6.  Develop and test object-oriented programs using appropriate tools and techniques.
