### Course Description:
This course provides a comprehensive introduction to the fundamental principles of information theory and coding. Students will explore the mathematical foundations of information theory, including entropy, mutual information, and channel capacity. The course will cover source coding techniques for data compression and channel coding techniques for reliable communication over noisy channels. Practical applications and real-world examples will be discussed throughout the semester.

### Prerequisites:
Calculus, Linear Algebra, Probability and Statistics

### Learning Objectives:
1.  Define and calculate entropy, mutual information, and related information measures.
2.  Apply source coding techniques, such as Huffman coding and arithmetic coding, to compress data.
3.  Evaluate the capacity of various communication channels.
4.  Implement channel coding techniques, including linear block codes and convolutional codes, for error detection and correction.
5.  Analyze the performance of different coding schemes in terms of rate, distortion, and error probability.
6.  Apply information-theoretic concepts to practical communication and data storage scenarios.
7.  Compare and contrast various coding techniques and their suitability for different applications.
