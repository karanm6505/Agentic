### Course Description:
This course provides a comprehensive introduction to the fundamental principles and techniques of digital signal processing (DSP). Students will learn about discrete-time signals and systems, the Z-transform, the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT), and various digital filter design methods. The course emphasizes both theoretical concepts and practical applications, including spectral analysis and filter implementation. Students will gain hands-on experience through programming assignments and DSP projects using software such as MATLAB or Python.

### Prerequisites:
Calculus II, Linear Algebra, and Introductory Programming (e.g., Python or MATLAB)

### Learning Objectives:
1.  Analyze discrete-time signals and systems in both time and frequency domains.
2.  Apply the Z-transform to analyze and characterize linear time-invariant (LTI) systems.
3.  Implement the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) and Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) algorithms.
4.  Design and implement both Finite Impulse Response (FIR) and Infinite Impulse Response (IIR) digital filters.
5.  Evaluate the performance of digital filters based on specifications and design constraints.
6.  Utilize DSP techniques for spectral analysis and signal processing applications.
7.  Develop programming skills to solve DSP problems.
