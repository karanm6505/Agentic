### Course Description:
This course provides a comprehensive introduction to the design of analog integrated circuits using CMOS technology. Students will learn the fundamental principles of analog circuit design, including circuit analysis, device modeling, and layout techniques. The course will cover the design and analysis of essential analog building blocks, such as operational amplifiers, current mirrors, voltage references, and comparators. Students will gain hands-on experience through circuit simulations using industry-standard software and will apply their knowledge to design and analyze practical analog circuits.

### Prerequisites:
EE210 (Circuit Analysis I), EE211 (Circuit Analysis II)

### Learning Objectives:
1.  Analyze the behavior of MOS transistors and their application in analog circuit design.
2.  Design and simulate basic analog building blocks, including current mirrors, and differential amplifiers.
3.  Evaluate the performance characteristics of operational amplifiers (op-amps), including gain, bandwidth, and stability.
4.  Implement design techniques for compensation and stability in op-amp circuits.
5.  Design and analyze switched-capacitor circuits.
6.  Apply layout techniques to minimize parasitic effects and improve circuit performance.
7.  Prepare a comprehensive design report documenting the design process, simulation results, and analysis of a chosen analog integrated circuit.
