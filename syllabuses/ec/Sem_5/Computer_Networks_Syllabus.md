### Course Description:
This course provides a comprehensive introduction to the principles and practice of computer networking. Students will explore the fundamental concepts of network architectures, protocols, and technologies that underpin the Internet and other modern networks. The course covers topics such as the layered network model, data transmission, routing, transport protocols, and network security. Students will gain hands-on experience through programming assignments and network simulation projects.

### Prerequisites:
CS 210 - Introduction to Programming, CS 220 - Data Structures and Algorithms

### Learning Objectives:
1.  Analyze the layered structure of network protocols (TCP/IP model).
2.  Implement network applications using socket programming.
3.  Evaluate different routing algorithms and their performance characteristics.
4.  Design and configure network security mechanisms to protect against common threats.
5.  Compare and contrast various network architectures (e.g., Ethernet, Wireless).
6.  Apply network simulation tools to model and analyze network behavior.
7.  Demonstrate understanding of transport layer protocols like TCP and UDP.
