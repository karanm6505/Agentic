### Course Description:
This course provides an in-depth exploration of advanced digital communication techniques. It covers advanced modulation schemes, including their performance analysis and implementation considerations. Furthermore, the course focuses on channel equalization techniques to mitigate the effects of intersymbol interference (ISI) and fading channels, enabling robust and reliable data transmission. Students will gain a strong theoretical foundation and practical experience through assignments and simulation projects.

### Prerequisites:

1.  Analyze the performance of various advanced modulation techniques in additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channels.
2.  Implement and evaluate the performance of advanced modulation schemes, such as QAM and OFDM, using software tools.
3.  Evaluate the impact of channel impairments on digital communication systems.
4.  Design and simulate equalization techniques for mitigating intersymbol interference.
5.  Compare and contrast different equalization algorithms, including linear and decision feedback equalizers.
6.  Apply advanced digital communication concepts to solve practical engineering problems.
