### Course Description:
This course provides an introduction to the principles and practices of Software Defined Radio (SDR). Students will explore the architecture of SDR systems, including digital signal processing techniques, radio frequency (RF) components, and software development methodologies. The course emphasizes the practical implementation of SDR systems, covering topics such as modulation and demodulation, signal analysis, and wireless communication protocols. Students will gain hands-on experience through programming assignments and a final SDR project.

### Prerequisites:
EE201 (Signals and Systems), EE210 (Digital Logic Design)

### Learning Objectives:
1.  Analyze the architecture and key components of Software Defined Radio systems.
2.  Implement digital signal processing (DSP) algorithms for SDR applications.
3.  Evaluate different modulation and demodulation techniques in SDR systems.
4.  Design and implement a basic wireless communication link using SDR.
5.  Develop software for SDR platforms, including GNU Radio.
6.  Troubleshoot and debug SDR hardware and software.
7.  Apply SDR principles to real-world communication scenarios.
