### Course Description:
This course provides a comprehensive introduction to the principles and practices of network security. Students will explore various network security protocols, cryptographic techniques, and common security threats. The course emphasizes hands-on experience through lab experiments and real-world case studies. Topics include network attacks, intrusion detection, firewalls, VPNs, and secure network design. Students will gain the knowledge and skills necessary to protect network resources and data from unauthorized access and malicious activities.

### Prerequisites:
Computer Networks (CS-240) or equivalent

### Learning Objectives:
1.  Analyze common network security threats and vulnerabilities.
2.  Implement cryptographic algorithms and protocols for secure communication.
3.  Evaluate the effectiveness of different security mechanisms.
