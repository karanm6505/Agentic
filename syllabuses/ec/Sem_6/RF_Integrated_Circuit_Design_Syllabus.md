### Course Description:
This course provides a comprehensive introduction to the design of Radio Frequency (RF) integrated circuits, with a focus on CMOS technology. Students will learn the fundamental principles of RF circuit design, including impedance matching, amplifier design, oscillator design, and mixer design. The course will cover both theoretical concepts and practical design techniques, utilizing industry-standard simulation tools. Students will gain hands-on experience through circuit simulation projects and will culminate in a design report.

### Prerequisites:
EE 331 (Electronic Circuits I), Knowledge of basic circuit analysis

### Learning Objectives:
1.  Analyze RF circuit performance using small-signal and large-signal analysis techniques.
2.  Design impedance matching networks for optimal power transfer.
3.  Implement low-noise amplifier (LNA) circuits and evaluate their performance metrics.
4.  Design and simulate various types of RF oscillators.
5.  Evaluate the performance of mixers and frequency synthesizers.
6.  Simulate and design RF circuits using industry-standard simulation software.
7.  Prepare a comprehensive design report documenting the design process and results.
