### Course Description:
This course introduces the fundamental principles of object-oriented programming (OOP). Students will learn the core concepts of OOP, including encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism. The course will cover the design and implementation of software systems using an object-oriented programming language, such as Java or C++. Emphasis will be placed on practical application through programming assignments and projects.

### Prerequisites:
Introduction to Programming (e.g., CS001)

### Learning Objectives:
1.  Define and explain the core principles of object-oriented programming.
2.  Implement classes, objects, and methods in an object-oriented programming language.
3.  Apply inheritance and polymorphism to design and develop reusable code.
4.  Utilize abstract classes and interfaces for flexible software design.
5.  Design and implement programs using object-oriented design patterns.
6.  Debug and test object-oriented programs effectively.
7.  Develop a substantial object-oriented project demonstrating course concepts.
