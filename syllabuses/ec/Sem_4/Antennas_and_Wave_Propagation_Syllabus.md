### Course Description:
This course provides a comprehensive introduction to the fundamental principles of antennas and radio wave propagation. Students will explore antenna theory, including radiation mechanisms, antenna parameters, and antenna arrays. The course also covers the design and analysis of various antenna types, such as dipoles, monopoles, and microstrip antennas. Furthermore, it delves into the characteristics of radio wave propagation in different environments, including free space, terrestrial, and satellite communications.
