### Course Description:
This course provides a comprehensive introduction to the theory and application of feedback control systems. Students will learn the fundamental concepts of control system analysis and design, including modeling, stability analysis, and controller synthesis. The course emphasizes both the theoretical foundations and practical implementation of control systems, with a strong focus on using MATLAB for simulation and analysis. Topics covered include transfer functions, time-domain and frequency-domain analysis, stability criteria, and controller design techniques.

### Prerequisites:
Differential Equations, Linear Algebra

### Learning Objectives:
1.  Model dynamic systems using transfer functions and state-space representations.
2.  Analyze the time-domain response of control systems, including transient and steady-state behavior.
3.  Evaluate the stability of control systems using various techniques, such as Routh-Hurwitz and Bode plots.
4.  Design controllers (e.g., PID, lead, lag) to meet specific performance specifications.
5.  Analyze system performance in the frequency domain using Bode plots and Nyquist plots.
6.  Implement and simulate control systems using MATLAB and Simulink.
7.  Apply control system principles to real-world engineering problems.
