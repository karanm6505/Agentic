### Course Description:
This course provides a comprehensive introduction to Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) design. Students will learn the fundamental principles of CMOS logic, circuit design, and layout techniques. The course covers the design flow, from behavioral description to physical implementation, using industry-standard Computer-Aided Design (CAD) tools. Emphasis will be placed on understanding the trade-offs between performance, power, and area in VLSI circuit design.

### Prerequisites:
EE201 (Circuit Analysis), EE210 (Digital Logic Design)

### Learning Objectives:
1.  Understand the VLSI design flow and different abstraction levels.
2.  Analyze and design CMOS logic gates and circuits.
3.  Implement digital circuits using CMOS technology.
4.  Design and simulate circuits using VLSI CAD tools.
5.  Evaluate the performance of digital circuits in terms of speed, power, and area.
6.  Create physical layouts for basic CMOS circuits.
7.  Apply knowledge to design a small-scale VLSI project.
