### Course Description:
This course provides a comprehensive introduction to the architecture, programming, and interfacing of microprocessors and microcontrollers. Students will explore the internal structure of processors, assembly language programming, memory organization, input/output techniques, and interrupt handling. The course will emphasize practical application through hands-on programming assignments and a final microcontroller-based project, providing students with the skills to design and implement embedded systems.

### Prerequisites:
Introduction to Digital Logic (CS 220 or equivalent)

### Learning Objectives:
1.  Analyze the architectural components of a microprocessor and a microcontroller.
2.  Write and debug assembly language programs for a target processor.
3.  Implement memory management techniques, including memory mapping and addressing modes.
4.  Design and implement input/output interfaces for various peripheral devices.
5.  Evaluate the use of interrupts for real-time system design.
6.  Develop and test microcontroller-based projects.
