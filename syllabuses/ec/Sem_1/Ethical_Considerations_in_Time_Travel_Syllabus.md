### Course Description:
This course delves into the complex ethical landscape of time travel, exploring the philosophical and practical implications of altering the past, present, or future. Students will analyze the paradoxes that arise from time travel scenarios, examine the potential impact on free will and determinism, and grapple with the moral responsibilities associated with wielding the power to manipulate time. Through critical discussions, case studies, and written assignments, students will develop a nuanced understanding of the ethical challenges inherent in temporal manipulation.

The course will consider diverse perspectives from philosophy, science fiction, and theoretical physics to build a comprehensive framework for ethical decision-making in the context of time travel. Topics will include the grandfather paradox, the butterfly effect, the ethics of historical intervention, and the potential for exploitation and abuse of time travel technology.
