### Course Description:
This introductory course provides a comprehensive foundation in programming principles for engineering students. Students will learn fundamental programming concepts, including data types, control structures, functions, and object-oriented programming, using a high-level language such as Python or C. The course emphasizes problem-solving, algorithm design, and practical application of programming skills to engineering problems. Students will gain the ability to write, debug, and test programs effectively.

### Prerequisites:
None

### Learning Objectives:
1.  Understand fundamental programming concepts such as variables, data types, and operators.
2.  Implement control structures (e.g., loops, conditional statements) to control program flow.
3.  Design and implement functions for modular code development.
4.  Apply programming techniques to solve engineering-related problems.
5.  Debug and test programs to identify and correct errors.
6.  Utilize fundamental data structures like arrays and lists.
7.  Develop a final project demonstrating the application of learned concepts.
