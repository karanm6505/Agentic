### Course Description:
This course provides an introduction to the fundamental principles of temporal mechanics, exploring the nature of time, causality, and the theoretical possibilities of time travel. Students will learn the mathematical and physical concepts necessary to understand current theories and debates surrounding temporal phenomena. The course will cover topics ranging from classical mechanics and relativity to quantum mechanics and exotic spacetime geometries.

### Prerequisites:
Physics I, Calculus I

### Learning Objectives:
1.  Explain the historical development of our understanding of time, from Newtonian mechanics to modern physics.
2.  Apply the principles of special and general relativity to analyze time dilation and other temporal effects.
3.  Evaluate the various paradoxes associated with time travel and propose potential resolutions.
4.  Analyze the theoretical feasibility of wormholes and other spacetime structures for time travel.
5.  Understand the role of quantum mechanics in shaping our understanding of time.
6.  Solve problems involving time-dependent phenomena in both classical and relativistic contexts.
