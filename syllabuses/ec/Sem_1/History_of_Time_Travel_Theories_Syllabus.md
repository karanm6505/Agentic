### Course Description:
This course provides a comprehensive survey of the history of time travel theories, exploring the evolution of this concept from its roots in ancient mythology and philosophical thought to its treatment in modern physics and science fiction. We will examine how cultural, scientific, and technological developments have shaped our understanding and imagination of time travel. Students will engage with primary and secondary sources, analyze key texts and films, and develop critical perspectives on the historical, scientific, and ethical implications of time travel.
