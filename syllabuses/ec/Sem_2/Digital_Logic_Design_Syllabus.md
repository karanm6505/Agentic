### Course Description:
This course provides a comprehensive introduction to the fundamental principles of digital logic design. Students will learn about Boolean algebra, logic gates, combinational and sequential circuit design, and the use of hardware description languages (HDLs). The course emphasizes both theoretical concepts and practical application through laboratory exercises and a design project. Students will gain the necessary skills to analyze, design, and implement digital circuits used in various electronic systems.

### Prerequisites:
Introductory Programming (CS 101) or equivalent, Basic Mathematics

### Learning Objectives:
1.  Analyze and simplify Boolean expressions using Boolean algebra and Karnaugh maps.
2.  Design and implement combinational logic circuits using logic gates.
3.  Design and implement sequential logic circuits, including flip-flops, counters, and registers.
4.  Understand and apply the principles of state machine design.
5.  Utilize Hardware Description Languages (HDLs) to model and simulate digital circuits.
6.  Implement digital designs using Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) in laboratory exercises.
7.  Evaluate the performance and efficiency of digital circuit designs.
