### Course Description:
This course provides a comprehensive introduction to the fundamental concepts of signals and systems. Students will learn about various signal types, system properties, and the mathematical tools used to analyze and manipulate signals in both the time and frequency domains. The course covers linear time-invariant (LTI) systems, convolution, Fourier analysis, and Laplace transforms. Emphasis will be placed on applying these concepts to solve practical problems in signal processing and systems engineering using MATLAB.

### Prerequisites:
Calculus I, Calculus II, Linear Algebra

### Learning Objectives:
1.  Analyze continuous-time and discrete-time signals and systems.
2.  Apply Fourier series and Fourier transforms to analyze signals in the frequency domain.
3.  Implement convolution techniques to determine the output of LTI systems.
4.  Evaluate system stability and causality.
5.  Utilize Laplace transforms to analyze and solve differential equations.
6.  Model and simulate signals and systems using MATLAB.
7.  Design basic signal processing systems.
