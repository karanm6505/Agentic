### Course Description:
This course provides a comprehensive introduction to fundamental data structures and algorithms. Students will learn about various data structures such as arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, and graphs, along with their respective operations and applications. The course emphasizes the analysis of algorithms, including time and space complexity, and explores different algorithmic paradigms such as divide-and-conquer and dynamic programming. Students will gain practical experience through programming assignments, implementing data structures and algorithms in a chosen programming language.

### Prerequisites:
Introduction to Programming (e.g., CS001)

### Learning Objectives:
1.  Analyze the time and space complexity of algorithms using Big O notation.
2.  Implement fundamental data structures, including arrays, linked lists, stacks, and queues.
3.  Apply tree structures, including binary trees, binary search trees, and heaps, to solve computational problems.
4.  Implement graph data structures and related algorithms such as breadth-first search and depth-first search.
5.  Evaluate different sorting and searching algorithms and understand their trade-offs.
6.  Design and implement efficient algorithms using various algorithmic paradigms.
7.  Apply data structures and algorithms to solve real-world problems.
