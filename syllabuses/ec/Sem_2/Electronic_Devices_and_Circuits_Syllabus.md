### Course Description:
This course provides a comprehensive introduction to the analysis and design of electronic circuits. Students will learn the fundamental principles of semiconductor device physics and apply these principles to understand the operation of diodes, transistors (BJT and MOSFET), and operational amplifiers (Op-Amps). Emphasis is placed on circuit analysis techniques, design considerations, and practical applications. Students will gain hands-on experience through laboratory experiments and circuit simulation projects.

### Prerequisites:
Physics 101, Calculus I

### Learning Objectives:
1.  Analyze the characteristics and operation of semiconductor diodes, including rectifiers and voltage regulators.
2.  Evaluate the behavior of Bipolar Junction Transistors (BJTs) and Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor Field-Effect Transistors (MOSFETs) in various circuit configurations.
3.  Design basic amplifier circuits using BJTs and MOSFETs.
4.  Implement circuit simulations using industry-standard software (e.g., SPICE).
5.  Analyze the operation of operational amplifiers (Op-Amps) and design Op-Amp-based circuits.
6.  Evaluate the frequency response of electronic circuits.
7.  Apply knowledge to solve real-world electronic circuit problems.
