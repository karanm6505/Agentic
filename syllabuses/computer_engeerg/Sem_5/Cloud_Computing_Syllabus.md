### Course Description:
This course provides a comprehensive introduction to cloud computing concepts, technologies, architecture, and services. Students will explore various cloud deployment models (public, private, hybrid), service models (IaaS, PaaS, SaaS), and essential cloud technologies such as virtualization, containers, and cloud storage. The course will also cover cloud security, resource management, and application development in the cloud. Hands-on exercises and a cloud deployment project will provide practical experience in designing, deploying, and managing cloud-based applications.

### Prerequisites:
Introduction to Computer Networks, Operating Systems, Data Structures and Algorithms

### Learning Objectives:
1.  Explain the fundamental concepts and architectures of cloud computing.
2.  Compare and contrast different cloud deployment and service models.
3.  Implement and manage virtual machines and containers in the cloud.
4.  Design and deploy scalable and resilient applications on cloud platforms.
5.  Evaluate cloud security risks and implement security best practices.
6.  Analyze the cost and performance of cloud-based solutions.
