### Course Description:
This course provides a comprehensive introduction to the principles and practices of expert systems. Students will learn about the fundamental concepts of knowledge representation, reasoning, and inference engines. The course covers various knowledge representation techniques, including rule-based systems, semantic networks, and frames. Students will also explore different reasoning strategies, such as forward chaining, backward chaining, and resolution. The course culminates in a project where students design and implement their own expert system to solve a real-world problem.

### Prerequisites:
Data Structures, Algorithms, Introduction to Artificial Intelligence

### Learning Objectives:
1.  Explain the fundamental concepts and architecture of expert systems.
2.  Apply various knowledge representation techniques to model domain knowledge.
3.  Implement different reasoning strategies for inference and problem-solving.
4.  Design and develop a complete expert system for a specific application.
5.  Evaluate the performance and limitations of expert systems.
6.  Compare and contrast different expert system development tools and methodologies.
