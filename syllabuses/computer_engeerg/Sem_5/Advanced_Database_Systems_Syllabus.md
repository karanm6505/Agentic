### Course Description:
This course provides an in-depth exploration of advanced database concepts beyond traditional relational database systems. Students will learn about NoSQL databases, data warehousing techniques, data mining principles, and the challenges of managing and analyzing large datasets. The course emphasizes practical application through assignments and a comprehensive database project, enabling students to design and implement advanced database solutions.

### Prerequisites:
CS330 (Introduction to Database Systems) or equivalent

### Learning Objectives:
1.  Analyze the architectural differences between relational and NoSQL database systems.
2.  Implement and manage NoSQL databases using different data models (e.g., document, key-value, graph).
3.  Design and develop data warehouses for effective business intelligence.
4.  Apply data mining techniques for knowledge discovery in large datasets.
5.  Evaluate the performance and scalability of different database solutions.
6.  Develop a comprehensive database project demonstrating advanced database concepts.
