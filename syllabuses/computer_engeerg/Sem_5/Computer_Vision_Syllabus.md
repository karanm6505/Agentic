### Course Description:
This course provides an introduction to the field of computer vision. Students will learn the fundamental principles and techniques used to enable computers to "see" and interpret images. Topics covered include image formation, image processing, feature extraction, object recognition, and scene understanding. The course emphasizes hands-on experience through programming assignments that allow students to implement and experiment with various computer vision algorithms.

This course is designed for undergraduate students with a basic understanding of programming and linear algebra. By the end of the course, students will be able to apply computer vision techniques to solve real-world problems.

### Prerequisites:
Introduction to Programming, Linear Algebra

### Learning Objectives:
1.  Describe the fundamental concepts of image formation and representation.
2.  Implement basic image processing techniques such as filtering, edge detection, and segmentation.
3.  Extract and describe image features for object recognition.
4.  Apply machine learning algorithms for object classification and detection.
5.  Understand the principles of scene understanding and 3D vision.
6.  Design and implement a computer vision project to solve a specific problem.
