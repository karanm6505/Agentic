### Course Description:
This course provides an introduction to the fundamental concepts and techniques in robotics. Students will learn about robot kinematics, dynamics, control, and perception. The course will cover topics such as robot motion planning, trajectory generation, sensor integration, and robot programming. Hands-on laboratory assignments will provide students with practical experience in designing, building, and controlling robots. A final project will allow students to apply their knowledge to a real-world robotics problem.

### Prerequisites:
Linear Algebra, Differential Equations, Introductory Programming

### Learning Objectives:
1.  Analyze the kinematic structure of robotic manipulators using Denavit-Hartenberg (DH) parameters.
2.  Formulate the dynamic equations of motion for robots using Lagrangian or Newton-Euler methods.
3.  Design and implement control algorithms for robot joint position and trajectory tracking.
4.  Integrate sensor data from cameras and other sensors to enable robot perception and environment understanding.
5.  Develop robot programs for performing specific tasks.
6.  Work effectively in teams to design, build, and test a robotic system.
