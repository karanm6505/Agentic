### Course Description:
This course provides an introduction to the exciting field of quantum computing. Students will learn the fundamental principles of quantum mechanics necessary for understanding quantum computation, including superposition, entanglement, and quantum measurement. The course will cover essential quantum algorithms such as Shor's algorithm and Grover's algorithm, and will also discuss the challenges and opportunities in building quantum computers. No prior knowledge of quantum mechanics is assumed, but a solid foundation in linear algebra and complex numbers is required.

### Prerequisites:
