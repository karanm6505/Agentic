### Course Description:
This course provides a comprehensive introduction to the fundamental concepts of discrete mathematics. Topics include propositional and predicate logic, set theory, relations, functions, combinatorics, and graph theory. Emphasis will be placed on developing problem-solving skills and applying these concepts to computer science and related fields. Students will learn to construct mathematical arguments and proofs, and to model and analyze discrete structures.

### Prerequisites:
Calculus I

### Learning Objectives:
1.  Apply propositional and predicate logic to construct valid arguments and proofs.
2.  Utilize set theory to model and analyze collections of objects.
3.  Analyze relations and functions and their properties.
4.  Solve counting problems using combinatorial techniques.
5.  Apply graph theory concepts to model and analyze networks and relationships.
6.  Construct mathematical proofs using various proof techniques, including induction.
