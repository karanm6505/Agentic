### Course Description:
This course provides a comprehensive introduction to the principles of computer organization and architecture. Students will explore the fundamental building blocks of computer systems, including instruction set architecture, central processing unit (CPU) design, memory hierarchy, input/output (I/O) systems, and pipelining. The course emphasizes the relationship between hardware and software and how architectural decisions impact performance. Through lectures, lab assignments, and a final project, students will gain hands-on experience with computer system design concepts.

The course covers topics such as data representation, assembly language programming, CPU control and datapath design, memory organization, cache memory, virtual memory, and I/O interfacing. Students will learn how to analyze the performance of computer systems and how to make informed design choices to optimize performance.

### Prerequisites:
Introduction to Digital Logic Design, Data Structures and Algorithms

### Learning Objectives:
1.  Understand the fundamental principles of computer organization and architecture.
2.  Analyze the performance implications of different architectural design choices.
