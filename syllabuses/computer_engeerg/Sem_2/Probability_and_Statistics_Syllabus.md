### Course Description:
This course provides an introduction to the fundamental concepts of probability and statistics. Students will learn basic probability theory, random variables, common probability distributions, hypothesis testing, and statistical inference. The course emphasizes both theoretical understanding and practical application of statistical methods. Students will gain experience in data analysis and interpretation using statistical software.

### Prerequisites:
MATH 101 (Calculus I)

### Learning Objectives:
1.  Calculate probabilities of events using basic probability rules and theorems.
2.  Distinguish between discrete and continuous random variables and apply appropriate probability distributions.
3.  Perform hypothesis tests and construct confidence intervals for population parameters.
4.  Apply statistical inference techniques to analyze real-world data.
5.  Interpret statistical results and draw meaningful conclusions.
6.  Use statistical software to perform data analysis and simulations.
