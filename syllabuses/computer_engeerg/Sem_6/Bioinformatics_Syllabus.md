### Course Description:
This course provides an introduction to the field of bioinformatics, emphasizing the computational methods used to analyze biological data. Students will learn about sequence alignment, phylogenetic analysis, gene expression analysis, and proteomics. The course will cover the fundamental principles of these methods and their applications in biological research. Students will also gain hands-on experience using bioinformatics tools and databases to solve real-world problems.

The course will emphasize the integration of biological knowledge with computational skills. Students will learn to formulate biological questions, design appropriate computational analyses, and interpret the results in a biological context. The course will prepare students for careers in biotechnology, pharmaceutical research, and academia.

### Prerequisites:
