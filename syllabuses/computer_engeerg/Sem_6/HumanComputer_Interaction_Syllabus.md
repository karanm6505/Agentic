### Course Description:
This course provides a comprehensive introduction to the field of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI). Students will learn the fundamental principles of user interface design, usability testing, and human factors. The course emphasizes a user-centered design approach, covering topics such as user research, interaction design, information architecture, and evaluation methods. Students will gain practical experience through hands-on projects and usability testing exercises.

### Prerequisites:
Introduction to Programming, Data Structures

### Learning Objectives:
1.  Apply user-centered design principles to create effective and engaging user interfaces.
2.  Conduct user research to understand user needs and behaviors.
3.  Design and prototype interactive systems using various design tools and techniques.
4.  Evaluate the usability of interactive systems using both qualitative and quantitative methods.
5.  Analyze human factors related to the design and use of computer systems.
6.  Communicate design ideas and research findings effectively through written reports and oral presentations.
