### Course Description:
This course provides a comprehensive introduction to the design and analysis of algorithms. Students will learn fundamental algorithm design techniques such as divide-and-conquer, dynamic programming, greedy algorithms, and graph algorithms. The course emphasizes analyzing the time and space complexity of algorithms to determine their efficiency. Topics also include NP-completeness and approximation algorithms for dealing with computationally hard problems.
