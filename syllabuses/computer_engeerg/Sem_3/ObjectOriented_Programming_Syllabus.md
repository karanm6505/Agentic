### Course Description:
This course builds upon introductory programming concepts to explore advanced object-oriented programming (OOP) techniques. Students will delve into topics such as design patterns, advanced data structures, software engineering principles, and testing methodologies within the context of object-oriented systems. Emphasis will be placed on developing robust, maintainable, and scalable software solutions. Students will gain practical experience through hands-on programming assignments and a substantial final project.

### Prerequisites:
Introduction to Programming, Data Structures

### Learning Objectives:
1.  Apply advanced object-oriented programming principles, including inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction, to solve complex software problems.
2.  Implement common design patterns to create flexible and reusable software architectures.
3.  Analyze and evaluate different software development methodologies and their impact on object-oriented projects.
4.  Design and implement unit tests to ensure code quality and reliability.
5.  Utilize advanced data structures and algorithms in object-oriented designs.
6.  Collaborate effectively in a team to develop a substantial software project.
