### Course Description:
This course provides a comprehensive introduction to computer networks, focusing on the underlying principles and practical aspects of network communication. Students will learn about network architectures, protocols, and technologies, with an emphasis on the TCP/IP protocol suite. Topics include network layering, addressing, routing, transport protocols, and network security. Hands-on lab assignments and a semester-long project will provide students with practical experience in network design, implementation, and analysis.

### Prerequisites:
Data Structures, Basic Programming Skills

### Learning Objectives:
1.  Analyze the fundamental concepts of computer networking and network architectures.
2.  Implement and evaluate various network protocols, including TCP/IP.
3.  Design and configure network routing algorithms.
4.  Apply network security principles to protect network infrastructure and data.
5.  Troubleshoot and diagnose common network problems.
6.  Evaluate the performance of different networking technologies.
