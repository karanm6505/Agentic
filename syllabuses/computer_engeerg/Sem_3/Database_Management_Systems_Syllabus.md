### Course Description:
This course provides a comprehensive introduction to database management systems. Students will learn the fundamental concepts of database design, the relational model, SQL, and database administration. Topics include data modeling, normalization, query optimization, transaction management, and security. Students will gain hands-on experience through assignments and a database project.

The course emphasizes practical application of database principles using a relational database management system. Students will design and implement a database application, learning to effectively manage and manipulate data. The course also covers emerging trends in database technology, such as NoSQL databases and cloud-based database services.

### Prerequisites:
Data Structures (CIS 210), Introduction to Programming (CIS 110)

### Learning Objectives:
1.  Design relational databases using entity-relationship diagrams and normalization techniques.
2.  Implement relational databases using SQL, including data definition, data manipulation, and data control languages.
3.  Analyze and optimize SQL queries for performance.
4.  Evaluate transaction management concepts, including concurrency control and recovery.
5.  Implement database security measures to protect data integrity and confidentiality.
6.  Administer and maintain database systems, including backup and recovery procedures.
