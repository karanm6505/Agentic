### Course Description:
This course provides a comprehensive introduction to the fundamental principles and practices of software engineering. Students will learn about the software development lifecycle, from requirements elicitation and analysis to design, implementation, testing, and maintenance. Emphasis will be placed on industry-standard methodologies, tools, and techniques for building reliable, scalable, and maintainable software systems. Students will gain hands-on experience through a group project, applying software engineering principles to solve a real-world problem.

The course also covers important aspects of software project management, including planning, scheduling, risk management, and quality assurance. Students will develop skills in teamwork, communication, and problem-solving, essential for success in the software industry.

### Prerequisites:
