### Course Description:
This course provides a comprehensive introduction to the principles and techniques of computer graphics. Students will learn about the graphics pipeline, 2D and 3D transformations, rendering algorithms, and shading models. The course emphasizes hands-on experience through programming assignments that allow students to implement and experiment with various graphics concepts. By the end of the course, students will have a strong foundation in computer graphics and be able to develop interactive graphics applications.

### Prerequisites:
Linear Algebra, Data Structures, Calculus I

### Learning Objectives:
1.  Understand the fundamental concepts of the graphics pipeline.
2.  Apply 2D and 3D transformations to manipulate graphical objects.
3.  Implement various rendering algorithms, including rasterization and ray tracing.
4.  Design and implement shading models to create realistic visual effects.
5.  Develop interactive graphics applications using OpenGL or similar graphics libraries.
6.  Analyze and compare different graphics techniques for performance and visual quality.
