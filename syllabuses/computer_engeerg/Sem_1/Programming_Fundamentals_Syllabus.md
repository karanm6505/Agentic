### Course Description:
This course provides an introduction to the fundamental concepts of computer programming. Students will learn the basic building blocks of programming, including data types, control structures, and functions. The course will also introduce object-oriented programming principles. Through hands-on exercises and programming assignments, students will develop problem-solving and programming skills using a high-level programming language.

### Prerequisites:
None

### Learning Objectives:
1.  Understand and apply fundamental programming concepts such as variables, data types, and operators.
2.  Implement control structures including conditional statements and loops to solve programming problems.
3.  Design and implement functions to modularize code and improve reusability.
4.  Apply object-oriented programming principles such as encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.
5.  Develop problem-solving skills through the design and implementation of programming solutions.
6.  Test and debug programs to ensure correctness and reliability.
