### Course Description:
This course provides an introduction to the fundamental concepts and techniques of causal inference. Students will learn how to identify causal relationships from observational data, design causal studies, and critically evaluate causal claims. Topics include potential outcomes, causal graphs, identification strategies, and sensitivity analysis. The course emphasizes the application of these techniques using programming assignments and a final project.

### Prerequisites:
STAT200 (Introduction to Statistics), MATH221 (Calculus I), CS101 (Introduction to Programming)

### Learning Objectives:
1.  Define and differentiate between association and causation.
2.  Construct causal diagrams to represent causal relationships.
3.  Apply potential outcomes framework to estimate causal effects.
4.  Implement various causal inference techniques, including matching, instrumental variables, and regression discontinuity.
5.  Assess the assumptions underlying causal inference methods.
6.  Interpret and communicate causal findings effectively.
