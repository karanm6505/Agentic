The course emphasizes hands-on experience with real-world time series data using statistical software. Topics include data visualization, stationarity, model identification, parameter estimation, diagnostic checking, and forecasting.

### Prerequisites:
Introductory Statistics, Linear Algebra, Basic Programming Skills

### Learning Objectives:
1.  Apply exploratory data analysis techniques to time series data.
2.  Assess the stationarity of a time series and apply appropriate transformations.
3.  Identify and estimate ARIMA models for time series data.
4.  Evaluate the performance of time series models using diagnostic checking.
5.  Generate forecasts using time series models and assess forecast accuracy.
6.  Implement time series analysis techniques using statistical software.
