### Course Description:
This course provides a comprehensive introduction to the field of data mining, focusing on techniques for extracting knowledge from large datasets. Students will learn about various data mining tasks, including classification, clustering, association rule mining, and anomaly detection. The course covers both theoretical foundations and practical applications, with an emphasis on hands-on experience using data mining tools and techniques. Students will gain the skills necessary to analyze real-world datasets, identify patterns, and make informed decisions based on data-driven insights.

The course includes lectures, programming assignments, quizzes, and a final project. Students will work with popular data mining software and libraries to implement and evaluate different data mining algorithms. The final project will provide an opportunity to apply the learned concepts and techniques to a real-world problem.
