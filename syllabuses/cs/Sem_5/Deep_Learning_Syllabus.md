### Course Description:
This course provides an introduction to the fundamental concepts and techniques of deep learning. Students will learn about various deep learning architectures, including feedforward neural networks, convolutional neural networks, and recurrent neural networks. The course will cover both the theoretical foundations and practical implementation of these models using popular deep learning frameworks. Students will gain hands-on experience through programming assignments and a final project.

### Prerequisites:
Linear Algebra, Calculus, Probability and Statistics, Programming experience (Python preferred)

### Learning Objectives:
1.  Explain the fundamental concepts of deep learning and neural networks.
2.  Implement and train various deep learning models using Python and deep learning frameworks such as TensorFlow or PyTorch.
3.  Apply deep learning techniques to solve real-world problems in areas such as image recognition, natural language processing, and time series analysis.
4.  Evaluate the performance of deep learning models and identify strategies for improvement.
5.  Design and implement a deep learning project from problem formulation to model deployment.
