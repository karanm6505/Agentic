### Course Description:
This course provides a comprehensive introduction to the theory and practice of AI-based recommendation systems. Students will learn about various recommendation techniques, including collaborative filtering, content-based filtering, and hybrid approaches. The course emphasizes the design and implementation of personalized recommendation systems, covering topics such as data collection, preprocessing, model building, and evaluation. Students will gain hands-on experience through programming assignments and a semester-long project.

The course will explore the challenges and opportunities of building recommendation systems in different domains, such as e-commerce, social media, and entertainment. Ethical considerations, such as fairness, transparency, and privacy, will also be discussed. By the end of the course, students will be able to design, implement, and evaluate effective recommendation systems for real-world applications.

### Prerequisites:
Data Structures and Algorithms, Introduction to Machine Learning, Probability and Statistics
