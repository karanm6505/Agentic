### Course Description:
This course provides an introduction to federated learning, a machine learning paradigm that enables training models on decentralized data sources without directly accessing the data. Students will learn the fundamental concepts, algorithms, and challenges associated with federated learning. The course will cover various federated learning techniques, including federated averaging, differential privacy, and secure aggregation. Students will gain hands-on experience implementing and evaluating federated learning algorithms through programming assignments and a final project.

### Prerequisites:
Machine Learning, Linear Algebra, Probability and Statistics, Python Programming

### Learning Objectives:
1.  Understand the principles and applications of federated learning.
2.  Implement and evaluate federated learning algorithms using Python.
3.  Analyze the challenges and limitations of federated learning in different scenarios.
4.  Apply privacy-preserving techniques in federated learning.
5.  Design and implement a federated learning system for a real-world application.
6.  Compare and contrast different federated learning algorithms and their performance.
