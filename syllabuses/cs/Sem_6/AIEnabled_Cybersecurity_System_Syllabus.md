### Course Description:
This course provides a comprehensive introduction to the application of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) techniques in cybersecurity. Students will learn the fundamental concepts of cybersecurity threats and vulnerabilities, as well as how AI and ML can be leveraged to detect, prevent, and respond to these threats. The course will focus on developing practical skills in building AI-based cybersecurity systems through hands-on projects and case studies. Topics include anomaly detection, intrusion detection, malware analysis, and security information and event management (SIEM).

### Prerequisites:
Introduction to Programming, Data Structures and Algorithms, Basic Probability and Statistics

### Learning Objectives:
1.  Understand the fundamental concepts of cybersecurity threats and vulnerabilities.
