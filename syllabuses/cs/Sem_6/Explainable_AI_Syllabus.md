### Course Description:
This course provides an introduction to the field of Explainable AI (XAI). As AI systems become increasingly prevalent in various aspects of life, it is crucial to understand how these systems make decisions. This course covers fundamental concepts and techniques for making AI models more interpretable and transparent. Students will learn about different XAI methods, including rule extraction, feature importance, and visualization techniques. The course will involve hands-on programming assignments and a final project to apply the learned concepts to real-world problems.

### Prerequisites:
Introduction to Machine Learning, Data Structures and Algorithms, Linear Algebra

### Learning Objectives:
1.  Explain the importance of interpretability and transparency in AI systems.
2.  Implement various techniques for explaining the decisions of machine learning models.
3.  Evaluate the effectiveness of different XAI methods in different contexts.
4.  Apply XAI techniques to real-world datasets and interpret the results.
5.  Compare and contrast different approaches to explainable AI.
6.  Design and implement an XAI solution for a specific problem.
