### Course Description:
This course provides a comprehensive introduction to cloud computing, covering fundamental concepts, architectures, and services. Students will explore various cloud platforms, including Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS), and Software as a Service (SaaS). Through hands-on programming assignments and a semester-long project, students will gain practical experience in deploying and managing applications in the cloud. The course also addresses essential aspects of cloud security, scalability, and cost optimization.

### Prerequisites:
Introduction to Programming, Data Structures and Algorithms, Computer Networks

### Learning Objectives:
1.  Describe the fundamental concepts and architectures of cloud computing.
2.  Compare and contrast different cloud service models (IaaS, PaaS, SaaS).
3.  Deploy and manage applications on major cloud platforms (e.g., AWS, Azure, GCP).
4.  Implement cloud security best practices to protect data and applications.
5.  Design scalable and cost-effective cloud solutions.
6.  Evaluate the trade-offs between different cloud deployment models (public, private, hybrid).
7.  Apply cloud computing principles to solve real-world problems through a semester-long project.
