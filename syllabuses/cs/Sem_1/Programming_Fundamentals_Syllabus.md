### Course Description:
This course provides a comprehensive introduction to the fundamental concepts of programming. Students will learn the basics of programming using Python, a high-level, versatile language widely used in various domains. Topics covered include data types, control structures, functions, object-oriented programming principles, and basic data structures. Through hands-on exercises and projects, students will develop problem-solving skills and gain practical experience in writing, testing, and debugging code.

### Prerequisites:
None

### Learning Objectives:
1.  Understand and apply fundamental programming concepts such as variables, data types, and operators.
2.  Design and implement programs using control structures like loops and conditional statements.
3.  Develop modular and reusable code using functions and object-oriented programming principles.
4.  Utilize basic data structures like lists and dictionaries to solve programming problems.
5.  Write, test, and debug Python code effectively.
6.  Apply problem-solving techniques to develop algorithms for various programming tasks.
