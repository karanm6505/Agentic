### Course Description:
This course provides an introduction to probability theory and statistical inference. Topics include descriptive statistics, basic probability concepts, random variables, probability distributions, sampling distributions, estimation, hypothesis testing, and linear regression. Emphasis will be placed on understanding the theoretical concepts and applying them to real-world problems using statistical software. Students will learn to critically evaluate statistical analyses and draw meaningful conclusions from data.

### Prerequisites:
MATH 101 (Calculus I) or equivalent

### Learning Objectives:
1.  Calculate probabilities of events using basic probability rules.
2.  Identify and apply appropriate probability distributions to model random phenomena.
3.  Construct confidence intervals for population parameters.
4.  Perform hypothesis tests to make inferences about population parameters.
5.  Apply linear regression techniques to model relationships between variables.
6.  Use statistical software to analyze data and interpret results.
