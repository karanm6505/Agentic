### Course Description:
This course provides a comprehensive introduction to the principles and practices of object-oriented programming (OOP). Students will learn fundamental OOP concepts such as encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction. The course emphasizes practical application through hands-on programming exercises and projects using Java. Students will develop the skills necessary to design, implement, and test robust and maintainable object-oriented software.

### Prerequisites:
Introduction to Programming (CS101) or equivalent

### Learning Objectives:
1.  Explain the core principles of object-oriented programming, including encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.
2.  Design and implement classes and objects in Java.
3.  Apply object-oriented design patterns to solve common programming problems.
4.  Develop and test object-oriented software using industry-standard tools and techniques.
5.  Utilize inheritance and polymorphism to create reusable and extensible code.
6.  Implement exception handling to create robust and fault-tolerant applications.
