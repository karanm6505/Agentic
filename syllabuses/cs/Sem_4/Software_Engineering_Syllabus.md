### Course Description:
This course provides a comprehensive introduction to the principles and practices of software engineering. Students will learn about the software development lifecycle, requirements engineering, software design, testing, and project management. The course emphasizes a hands-on approach, with students working on a group project to apply the concepts learned in class.

Students will gain practical experience in software development methodologies, including Agile and Waterfall, and learn how to select the appropriate methodology for a given project. The course also covers important topics such as software quality assurance, configuration management, and software maintenance.

### Prerequisites:
