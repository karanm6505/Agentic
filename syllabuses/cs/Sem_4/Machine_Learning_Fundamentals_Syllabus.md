### Course Description:
This course provides an introduction to the fundamental concepts and techniques of machine learning. Students will learn about supervised and unsupervised learning algorithms, including linear regression, logistic regression, decision trees, clustering, and neural networks. The course emphasizes hands-on experience through programming assignments and a final project, enabling students to apply these algorithms to real-world datasets. Students will also gain an understanding of model evaluation, cross-validation, and hyperparameter tuning.

### Prerequisites:
Data Structures, Calculus I, Linear Algebra, Probability and Statistics
