### Course Description:
This course provides a comprehensive introduction to the principles and practices of computer architecture. Students will learn about the organization and design of modern computer systems, covering topics such as instruction set architecture, CPU design, memory hierarchy, input/output systems, and parallel processing. Emphasis is placed on understanding the trade-offs involved in designing high-performance and energy-efficient computer systems.

The course includes hands-on lab assignments that allow students to apply the concepts learned in class to real-world problems. Students will also complete a significant design project, where they will design and simulate a simplified computer system.

### Prerequisites:
ECE 270 (Introduction to Digital Logic)

### Learning Objectives:
1.  Explain the fundamental principles of computer architecture, including instruction set architecture, CPU design, memory hierarchy, and I/O systems.
2.  Analyze the performance of different computer architectures using quantitative metrics.
3.  Design and implement basic computer system components, such as arithmetic logic units (ALUs) and memory controllers.
4.  Evaluate the trade-offs involved in designing high-performance and energy-efficient computer systems.
5.  Apply computer architecture principles to solve real-world problems.
6.  Use industry-standard simulation tools to model and analyze computer system performance.
