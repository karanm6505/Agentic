### Course Description:
This course provides a comprehensive introduction to database management systems (DBMS). Students will learn the fundamental concepts of database design, including data modeling, normalization, and relational database principles. The course will also cover SQL, the standard language for interacting with databases, and explore various aspects of database implementation and administration. Through lectures, hands-on exercises, and a semester-long project, students will gain practical experience in designing, implementing, and querying databases.

### Prerequisites:
Introduction to Programming, Data Structures

### Learning Objectives:
1.  Design relational database schemas based on real-world requirements.
2.  Implement database systems using SQL.
3.  Apply normalization techniques to optimize database design.
4.  Evaluate the performance of database queries and implement optimization strategies.
5.  Develop database applications using a variety of programming languages and tools.
6.  Understand the principles of database transaction management and concurrency control.
