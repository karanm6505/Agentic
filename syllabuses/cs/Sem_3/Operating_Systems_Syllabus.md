### Course Description:
This course provides a comprehensive introduction to the fundamental principles and concepts underlying modern operating systems. Students will explore key areas such as process management, memory management, file systems, and I/O systems. The course emphasizes both theoretical understanding and practical application through programming assignments and a group project. Students will gain hands-on experience with system calls and kernel-level programming concepts.

### Prerequisites:
Data Structures, Computer Architecture

### Learning Objectives:
1.  Describe the fundamental components and services provided by operating systems.
2.  Analyze and compare different process scheduling algorithms.
3.  Implement solutions for process synchronization and deadlock handling.
4.  Evaluate various memory management techniques, including virtual memory.
5.  Design and implement file systems with consideration for performance and security.
6.  Explain the concepts of I/O management and device drivers.
