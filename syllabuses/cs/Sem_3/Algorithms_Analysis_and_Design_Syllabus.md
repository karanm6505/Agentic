### Course Description:
This course provides a comprehensive introduction to the design and analysis of efficient algorithms. Students will learn fundamental algorithmic techniques, including divide-and-conquer, dynamic programming, greedy algorithms, and graph algorithms. The course emphasizes rigorous analysis of algorithm correctness and time complexity, using asymptotic notation and recurrence relations. Students will also gain practical experience in implementing and evaluating algorithms through programming assignments.
