### Course Description:
This course provides a comprehensive introduction to the field of computer vision. Students will learn fundamental techniques that enable computers to "see" and interpret images and videos, mimicking and extending human visual capabilities. Topics covered include image formation, feature extraction, object recognition, image segmentation, and video analysis. The course emphasizes both theoretical understanding and practical implementation through programming assignments and a final project.

### Prerequisites:
Data Structures and Algorithms, Linear Algebra, Basic Programming Knowledge (Python preferred)

### Learning Objectives:
1.  Understand the principles of image formation and the underlying mathematical models.
2.  Implement fundamental image processing techniques, such as filtering and edge detection.
3.  Apply feature extraction methods for image representation.
4.  Develop object recognition systems using machine learning techniques.
5.  Analyze video sequences and perform basic video processing tasks.
6.  Design and implement a computer vision project addressing a specific problem.
7.  Evaluate the performance of computer vision algorithms and systems.
