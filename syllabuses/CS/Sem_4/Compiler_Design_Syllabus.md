### Course Description:
This course provides a comprehensive introduction to the principles and practices of compiler design. Students will learn the fundamental concepts and techniques used to translate high-level programming languages into machine code. Topics include lexical analysis, parsing (including top-down and bottom-up parsing techniques), semantic analysis, intermediate code generation, code optimization, and target code generation. The course emphasizes the theoretical foundations of compilers and their practical implementation.

### Prerequisites:
Data Structures and Algorithms, Discrete Mathematics

### Learning Objectives:
1.  Analyze the phases of a compiler and understand their interrelationships.
2.  Implement lexical analyzers using regular expressions and finite automata.
3.  Construct parsers using context-free grammars and parsing techniques (e.g., LL, LR).
4.  Apply semantic analysis techniques, including type checking and symbol table management.
5.  Generate intermediate code representations (e.g., three-address code).
6.  Evaluate code optimization techniques and their impact on performance.
7.  Design and implement a compiler for a simple programming language.
