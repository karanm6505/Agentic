This course provides a comprehensive introduction to the fundamental concepts and techniques of data mining. Students will learn how to extract valuable knowledge and insights from large datasets using various methods, including data preprocessing, association rule mining, classification, clustering, and anomaly detection. The course emphasizes hands-on experience with real-world datasets and practical applications of data mining techniques.

### Prerequisites:
Introduction to Programming (e.g., Python), Introductory Statistics

### Learning Objectives:
1.  Understand the fundamental concepts and principles of data mining.
2.  Apply data preprocessing techniques to clean and prepare data for analysis.
3.  Implement association rule mining algorithms to discover patterns in datasets.
4.  Develop and evaluate classification models for predictive analysis.
5.  Apply clustering algorithms to group similar data points.
6.  Identify and address anomaly detection challenges in various datasets.
7.  Evaluate the performance of data mining models using appropriate metrics.
