### Course Description:
This course provides a foundational understanding of computer programming principles. Students will learn the fundamental concepts of programming, including data types, control structures, functions, and object-oriented programming. Through hands-on exercises and programming assignments, students will develop the skills to design, write, and debug programs in a high-level programming language (Python). The course emphasizes problem-solving, algorithmic thinking, and code readability.

### Prerequisites:
None

### Learning Objectives:
1.  Understand fundamental programming concepts such as variables, data types, and operators.
2.  Implement control structures (e.g., loops and conditional statements) to control program flow.
3.  Design and write functions to modularize code and promote reusability.
4.  Apply data structures (e.g., lists, dictionaries) to organize and manipulate data.
5.  Analyze and debug code to identify and resolve errors.
6.  Develop object-oriented programs using classes and objects.
