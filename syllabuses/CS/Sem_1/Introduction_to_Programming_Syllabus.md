### Course Description:
This course provides a comprehensive introduction to the fundamental concepts of computer programming. Students will learn the core principles of programming logic, algorithm design, and problem-solving using a high-level programming language (e.g., Python). The course emphasizes hands-on experience through coding assignments, reinforcing theoretical knowledge with practical application. Topics covered include data types, control structures, functions, and basic data structures.

### Prerequisites:
None

### Learning Objectives:
1.  Understand the fundamental principles of programming, including syntax and semantics.
2.  Apply control structures (e.g., loops, conditionals) to solve programming problems.
3.  Utilize various data types (e.g., integers, strings, booleans) and data structures (e.g., lists, dictionaries).
4.  Design and implement functions to modularize code and improve reusability.
5.  Write and debug programs using a chosen programming language.
6.  Analyze and interpret code to understand its functionality.
7.  Develop basic algorithms for common programming tasks.
