### Course Description:
This course provides a comprehensive introduction to the design and implementation of digital circuits. Students will learn the fundamental concepts of Boolean algebra, logic gates, combinational and sequential circuit design, and the use of hardware description languages (HDLs). The course emphasizes both theoretical understanding and practical application through laboratory exercises and design projects. Students will gain hands-on experience with circuit simulation and prototyping tools.

### Prerequisites:
Introduction to Electrical Engineering, Basic Programming Concepts

### Learning Objectives:
1.  Analyze and simplify Boolean expressions using algebraic manipulation and Karnaugh maps.
2.  Design and implement combinational logic circuits using logic gates.
3.  Design and implement sequential logic circuits, including flip-flops, registers, and counters.
4.  Apply state machine design principles to create digital systems.
5.  Utilize hardware description languages (HDLs) for circuit modeling and simulation.
6.  Evaluate the performance and characteristics of digital circuits.
7.  Implement digital circuits using programmable logic devices (PLDs) and field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs).
