### Course Description:
This course provides a comprehensive introduction to the design, implementation, and management of database systems. Students will learn fundamental concepts, including data modeling, database design, query languages (SQL), database administration, and transaction management. The course emphasizes both theoretical foundations and practical application, utilizing hands-on lab assignments and a significant project to reinforce learning. Students will gain the skills necessary to design and implement relational databases and understand the principles of database management.

### Prerequisites:
CS210 (Data Structures and Algorithms)

### Learning Objectives:
1.  Analyze data requirements and develop appropriate database schemas using conceptual and logical data modeling techniques.
2.  Design relational databases, considering normalization principles and performance optimization.
3.  Implement database solutions using SQL, including creating tables, inserting data, querying data, and managing database objects.
4.  Evaluate database performance and identify areas for improvement through indexing and query optimization techniques.
5.  Apply database administration tasks, including user management, backup and recovery, and security implementation.
6.  Implement basic transaction management and concurrency control mechanisms.
7.  Compare and contrast different database models and architectures.
