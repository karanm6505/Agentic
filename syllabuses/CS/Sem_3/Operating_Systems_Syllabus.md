### Course Description:
This course provides a comprehensive introduction to the fundamental concepts and principles of operating system design and implementation. Students will explore the core components of an operating system, including process management, memory management, file systems, and I/O systems. The course will cover both theoretical aspects and practical implementation details, with an emphasis on the challenges of resource management, concurrency, and security. Students will gain hands-on experience through programming assignments and a substantial course project.

### Prerequisites:
Data Structures and Algorithms, Computer Architecture

### Learning Objectives:
1.  Understand the fundamental concepts of operating system structures and services.
2.  Analyze and apply process management techniques, including scheduling algorithms and synchronization mechanisms.
3.  Implement memory management strategies such as paging and virtual memory.
4.  Evaluate different file system designs and their performance characteristics.
5.  Design and implement solutions for concurrency and inter-process communication.
6.  Assess security and protection mechanisms within operating systems.
7.  Develop a working understanding of operating system kernel design.
