### Course Description:
This course provides a comprehensive introduction to the fundamental concepts and principles of computer networks. Students will explore network architectures, protocols, and technologies, with a strong emphasis on the TCP/IP protocol suite. The course will cover topics such as network layers, addressing, routing, transport protocols, and network security. Hands-on lab exercises will reinforce theoretical knowledge and provide practical experience in network configuration and troubleshooting.

### Prerequisites:
Introduction to Programming, Data Structures and Algorithms

### Learning Objectives:
1.  Analyze the layered architecture of computer networks and describe the functions of each layer.
2.  Implement network protocols using programming tools.
3.  Evaluate the performance of different network protocols and architectures.
4.  Design and configure network devices and systems.
5.  Apply security principles and techniques to protect network resources.
6.  Compare and contrast various network topologies and their characteristics.
