### Course Description:
This course provides a comprehensive introduction to the principles of computer networking. Students will explore network architectures, protocols, and the underlying technologies that enable communication across various networks, including the Internet. Topics covered will include the Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model, Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP), network security, and wireless networks. Students will gain hands-on experience through laboratory assignments and projects, solidifying their understanding of network concepts.

### Prerequisites:
CS 101 - Introduction to Programming

### Learning Objectives:
1.  Explain the fundamental concepts of computer networking, including network topologies and architectures.
2.  Differentiate between the layers of the OSI and TCP/IP models and describe their functions.
3.  Analyze the characteristics and functionalities of various network protocols, such as TCP, UDP, HTTP, and DNS.
4.  Implement basic network configurations using routers and switches.
5.  Evaluate network performance and identify potential bottlenecks.
6.  Apply security principles to protect network resources.
7.  Design and implement a small-scale network for a given scenario.
