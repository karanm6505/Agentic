### Course Description:
This course provides a comprehensive introduction to the fundamental principles and practices of software engineering. Students will explore various software development methodologies, including Agile and Waterfall, and gain practical experience in software design, implementation, and testing. Emphasis will be placed on software quality, maintainability, and the software development lifecycle. Students will learn to apply these principles to real-world software projects.

### Prerequisites:
CS 210 (Programming I) and CS 220 (Data Structures and Algorithms)

### Learning Objectives:
1.  Analyze different software development methodologies and their suitability for various projects.
2.  Design software systems using object-oriented principles and design patterns.
3.  Implement software solutions using appropriate programming languages and tools.
4.  Apply software testing techniques to ensure software quality and reliability.
5.  Evaluate the trade-offs between different software design choices.
6.  Create software documentation, including requirements specifications and design documents.
7.  Manage software projects using version control and collaboration tools.
