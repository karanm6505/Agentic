### Course Description:
This course is the second part of the introductory calculus sequence. It builds upon the concepts introduced in Calculus I, focusing on the theory and applications of integration. Topics include techniques of integration, applications of integration (area, volume, arc length), improper integrals, sequences and series, and an introduction to differential equations. Students will develop a strong understanding of integral calculus and its applications in various fields. Emphasis will be placed on problem-solving and analytical skills.

### Prerequisites:
Calculus I (MATH 101)

### Learning Objectives:
1.  Apply various integration techniques, including substitution, integration by parts, trigonometric integrals, and partial fractions.
2.  Calculate areas, volumes, and arc lengths using definite integrals.
3.  Evaluate improper integrals and determine their convergence or divergence.
4.  Analyze sequences and series, including tests for convergence and divergence.
5.  Determine the radius and interval of convergence for power series.
6.  Solve separable differential equations and apply them to real-world problems.
7.  Apply calculus concepts to solve applied problems in science and engineering.
