### Course Description:
This course provides a comprehensive introduction to the fundamental principles of computer organization and architecture. Students will explore the structure and function of computer systems, including the central processing unit (CPU), memory hierarchy, input/output (I/O) systems, and instruction set architecture (ISA). The course will cover topics such as data representation, logic design, processor design, memory organization, and parallel processing concepts. Students will gain a deep understanding of how computer hardware works and its impact on software performance.

### Prerequisites:
CS 210 - Introduction to Programming; CS 220 - Discrete Structures

### Learning Objectives:
1.  Analyze the functional units of a computer system and their interactions.
2.  Implement assembly language programs and understand their execution.
3.  Evaluate different memory organization techniques, including cache and virtual memory.
4.  Design basic logic circuits and understand their role in computer hardware.
5.  Compare and contrast different CPU architectures and their performance characteristics.
6.  Apply knowledge of I/O systems and their interaction with the CPU and memory.
7.  Assess the impact of hardware design choices on software performance.
