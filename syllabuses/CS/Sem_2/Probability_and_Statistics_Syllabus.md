### Course Description:
This course provides a foundational understanding of probability theory and statistical methods. Students will learn fundamental concepts of probability, including random variables, probability distributions, and the Central Limit Theorem. The course will also cover essential statistical techniques such as descriptive statistics, confidence intervals, hypothesis testing, and regression analysis. Emphasis will be placed on applying these concepts to real-world data analysis and problem-solving.

### Prerequisites:
College Algebra

### Learning Objectives:
1.  Define and apply fundamental concepts of probability, including sample spaces, events, and conditional probability.
2.  Calculate and interpret probabilities using various probability distributions (e.g., binomial, Poisson, normal).
3.  Summarize and visualize data using descriptive statistics and graphical methods.
4.  Construct and interpret confidence intervals for population parameters.
5.  Perform hypothesis tests for means, proportions, and variances.
6.  Apply regression analysis to model relationships between variables and make predictions.
7.  Utilize statistical software (e.g., R, Python) for data analysis and interpretation.
