### Course Description:
This course provides a comprehensive introduction to the principles and practices of object-oriented programming (OOP). Students will learn fundamental concepts such as classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, and abstraction. The course emphasizes software design methodologies, including design patterns and best practices for building robust and maintainable software systems. Students will gain practical experience through programming assignments and projects using a modern object-oriented programming language (e.g., Java or C++).

### Prerequisites:
Introduction to Programming (e.g., CS100)

### Learning Objectives:
1.  Define and differentiate between core OOP concepts: classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, and abstraction.
2.  Implement object-oriented designs using a chosen programming language.
3.  Apply inheritance and polymorphism to create flexible and reusable code.
4.  Design and implement applications using common design patterns.
5.  Analyze and evaluate the design of object-oriented systems.
6.  Write well-documented and maintainable code.
7.  Debug and test object-oriented programs effectively.
