### Course Description:
This course provides a comprehensive introduction to the design, implementation, and analysis of fundamental data structures and algorithms. Students will learn about abstract data types, common data structures such as arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, and graphs, and essential algorithms for searching, sorting, and graph traversal. Emphasis is placed on the practical application of these concepts through programming assignments and coding challenges, as well as the theoretical understanding of algorithm efficiency and complexity analysis.

### Prerequisites:
CS 101 - Introduction to Programming (or equivalent)

### Learning Objectives:
1.  Implement various data structures using a high-level programming language (e.g., Java or Python).
2.  Analyze the time and space complexity of algorithms using Big O notation.
3.  Apply appropriate data structures to solve computational problems.
4.  Design and implement efficient algorithms for searching and sorting data.
5.  Understand and apply graph algorithms for solving real-world problems.
6.  Evaluate the trade-offs between different data structures and algorithms.
7.  Write clear, well-documented, and efficient code.
