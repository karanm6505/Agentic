### Course Description:
This course provides a comprehensive introduction to the fundamental concepts of programming using Python. Students will learn the basics of procedural programming, including data types, control structures, functions, and object-oriented principles. The course also covers essential data structures such as lists, dictionaries, and sets, as well as basic algorithms for searching and sorting. Through hands-on coding assignments and projects, students will develop problem-solving skills and gain practical experience in designing, implementing, and debugging Python programs.

### Prerequisites:
None

### Learning Objectives:
1.  Understand and apply fundamental programming concepts, including variables, data types, control structures, and functions.
2.  Design, implement, and debug Python programs to solve a variety of computational problems.
3.  Utilize data structures such as lists, dictionaries, and sets to efficiently store and manipulate data.
4.  Implement basic algorithms for searching and sorting.
5.  Apply object-oriented programming principles to create modular and reusable code.
