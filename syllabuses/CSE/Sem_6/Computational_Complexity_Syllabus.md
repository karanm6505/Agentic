### Course Description:
This course provides a comprehensive introduction to the theory of computational complexity. We will explore fundamental concepts such as time and space complexity, complexity classes like P, NP, and NP-complete, and techniques for proving NP-completeness. We will also delve into approximation algorithms for NP-hard problems. This course emphasizes theoretical foundations and practical applications in algorithm design and analysis.

### Prerequisites:
Data Structures and Algorithms, Discrete Mathematics

### Learning Objectives:
1.  Analyze the time and space complexity of algorithms using asymptotic notation.
2.  Classify computational problems into different complexity classes (P, NP, NP-complete, etc.).
3.  Prove the NP-completeness of new problems using polynomial-time reductions.
4.  Design and analyze approximation algorithms for NP-hard optimization problems.
5.  Understand the theoretical limits of computation and the implications for algorithm design.
6.  Apply techniques to address computationally hard problems in real-world scenarios.
