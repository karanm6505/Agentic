### Course Description:
This course provides a comprehensive introduction to the theory of computation, focusing on formal models of computation such as finite automata, pushdown automata, and Turing machines. Students will learn how these models relate to formal languages and the Chomsky hierarchy. The course emphasizes both theoretical foundations and practical applications, enabling students to understand the capabilities and limitations of different computational models.

### Prerequisites:
Discrete Mathematics, Data Structures

### Learning Objectives:
1.  Analyze the behavior of finite automata and regular expressions.
2.  Design pushdown automata for context-free languages.
3.  Construct Turing machines for various computational tasks.
4.  Prove the decidability or undecidability of problems.
5.  Apply pumping lemmas to demonstrate the non-regularity or non-context-freeness of languages.
6.  Understand the Chomsky hierarchy and the relationships between different classes of formal languages.
