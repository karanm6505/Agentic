### Course Description:
This course provides a comprehensive introduction to network security principles and practices. Students will learn about fundamental security concepts, common network vulnerabilities, and various security mechanisms used to protect network infrastructure and data. The course will cover network security protocols, firewall technologies, intrusion detection and prevention systems, and security management practices. Hands-on programming projects and report writing will reinforce theoretical concepts and provide practical experience in implementing and evaluating network security solutions.

### Prerequisites:
Computer Networks, Operating Systems, Data Structures

### Learning Objectives:
1.  Analyze common network vulnerabilities and attacks.
2.  Implement and evaluate network security protocols such as TLS/SSL and IPsec.
3.  Configure and manage firewalls to enforce network security policies.
4.  Design and implement intrusion detection systems to identify malicious network activity.
5.  Assess the security of network systems and propose appropriate security countermeasures.
6.  Apply cryptographic principles to secure network communications.
