### Course Description:
This course provides a comprehensive introduction to the field of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI). Students will learn the fundamental principles of HCI, focusing on user-centered design methodologies. Topics include understanding user needs, designing effective user interfaces, and evaluating the usability of interactive systems. The course emphasizes hands-on experience through design projects and usability testing, enabling students to create user-friendly and engaging applications.

### Prerequisites:
Introduction to Programming, Data Structures

### Learning Objectives:
1.  Apply user-centered design principles to create effective and engaging user interfaces.
2.  Conduct user research to understand user needs and requirements.
3.  Design and prototype interactive systems using various design tools and techniques.
4.  Evaluate the usability of interactive systems using established usability testing methods.
5.  Analyze and interpret usability testing data to identify design improvements.
6.  Collaborate effectively in teams to develop and present HCI design projects.
