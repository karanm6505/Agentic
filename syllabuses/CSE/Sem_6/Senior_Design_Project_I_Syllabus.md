### Course Description:
Senior Design Project I is the first course in a two-semester capstone sequence for senior-level Computer Science students. This course focuses on the initial stages of a significant computer science project, including project selection, team formation, proposal development, and detailed system design. Students will work in teams to define a project with real-world applications, conduct a thorough literature review, and produce a comprehensive design document. Emphasis is placed on project management, teamwork, and effective communication.

### Prerequisites:
Data Structures and Algorithms, Software Engineering, Database Systems

### Learning Objectives:
1.  Formulate a comprehensive project proposal that addresses a significant problem within the field of computer science.
2.  Conduct a thorough literature review to identify existing solutions and research gaps related to the proposed project.
3.  Develop a detailed system design document that outlines the architecture, components, and interfaces of the project.
4.  Apply project management techniques to effectively plan, execute, and monitor project progress.
5.  Collaborate effectively within a team environment to achieve project goals.
6.  Communicate technical information clearly and concisely through written reports and oral presentations.
