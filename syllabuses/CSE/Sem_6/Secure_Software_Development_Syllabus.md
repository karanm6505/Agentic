### Course Description:
This course provides an introduction to the principles and practices of secure software development. Students will learn how to identify, analyze, and mitigate common software vulnerabilities, and how to develop secure coding practices. The course covers a range of topics, including input validation, authentication, authorization, cryptography, and secure configuration management. Students will gain hands-on experience through programming projects and vulnerability analysis exercises.

### Prerequisites:

### Learning Objectives:
1.  Analyze common software vulnerabilities, such as buffer overflows, SQL injection, and cross-site scripting.
2.  Implement secure coding practices to mitigate software vulnerabilities.
3.  Evaluate the security of existing software systems.
4.  Apply cryptographic techniques to protect sensitive data.
5.  Develop secure software applications that adhere to industry best practices.
6.  Understand and apply principles of authentication and authorization.
