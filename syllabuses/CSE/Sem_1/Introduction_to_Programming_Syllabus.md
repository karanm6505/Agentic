### Course Description:
This course provides a comprehensive introduction to the fundamental concepts of programming. Students will learn about data types, control structures, functions, and basic algorithms. Emphasis will be placed on developing problem-solving skills and writing clear, concise, and well-documented code. The primary programming language used in this course will be Python. No prior programming experience is required.

### Prerequisites:
None

### Learning Objectives:
1.  Understand and apply fundamental programming concepts such as variables, data types, and operators.
2.  Design and implement programs using control structures such as conditional statements and loops.
3.  Develop and utilize functions to modularize code and improve reusability.
4.  Apply basic algorithms to solve common programming problems.
5.  Write clear, concise, and well-documented Python code.
6.  Test and debug programs to ensure correctness and robustness.
7.  Understand the principles of object-oriented programming.
