### Course Description:
This course provides a comprehensive introduction to the fundamental concepts of computer organization and architecture. Students will explore the inner workings of computer systems, including the central processing unit (CPU), memory hierarchy, input/output (I/O) systems, and instruction set architectures. The course emphasizes the relationship between hardware and software and how architectural choices impact system performance. Through lectures, laboratory assignments, and hands-on exercises, students will gain a practical understanding of how computers execute instructions and manage data.

### Prerequisites:
Introduction to Programming, Digital Logic Design

### Learning Objectives:
1.  Describe the functional components of a computer and their interrelationships.
2.  Explain different instruction set architectures and their impact on program execution.
3.  Analyze the organization and operation of various memory systems, including cache and virtual memory.
4.  Evaluate different I/O techniques and their impact on system performance.
5.  Design and implement simple assembly language programs.
6.  Compare and contrast different approaches to computer architecture.
