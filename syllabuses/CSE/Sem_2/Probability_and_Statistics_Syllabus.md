### Course Description:
This course provides an introduction to the fundamental concepts of probability and statistics. Students will learn basic probability theory, including random variables, probability distributions, and expectation. The course will also cover statistical inference, including point and interval estimation, hypothesis testing, and simple linear regression. Emphasis will be placed on applying these concepts to real-world problems.

### Prerequisites:
MATH 101 (Calculus I)

### Learning Objectives:
1.  Calculate probabilities using basic probability rules and understand conditional probability.
2.  Identify and apply common probability distributions, such as the binomial, Poisson, and normal distributions.
3.  Construct confidence intervals for population parameters and interpret their meaning.
4.  Perform hypothesis tests for means, proportions, and variances.
5.  Apply simple linear regression to model the relationship between two variables.
6.  Interpret the results of statistical analyses and draw meaningful conclusions.
