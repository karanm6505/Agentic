### Course Description:
This course provides a comprehensive introduction to the principles and practices of object-oriented programming (OOP). Students will learn the fundamental concepts of OOP, including encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism, and how to apply these concepts to design and develop robust and maintainable software. The course emphasizes hands-on experience through programming projects using a modern object-oriented language.

The course covers object-oriented design principles, UML diagrams, and best practices for developing high-quality object-oriented software. Students will gain experience in designing, implementing, testing, and debugging object-oriented applications.

### Prerequisites:
Introduction to Programming (CS101) or equivalent

### Learning Objectives:
1.  Explain the core principles of object-oriented programming, including encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.
2.  Design and implement classes and objects using a modern object-oriented programming language.
3.  Apply object-oriented design principles to create modular, reusable, and maintainable software.
4.  Utilize UML diagrams to model and document object-oriented designs.
5.  Implement inheritance and polymorphism to create flexible and extensible software systems.
6.  Develop robust and well-tested object-oriented applications.
