### Course Description:
This course is a continuation of Calculus I, focusing on advanced techniques of integration, infinite sequences and series, and applications of calculus to various fields. Students will develop a strong understanding of these concepts through rigorous problem-solving and theoretical exploration. Topics include integration by parts, trigonometric integrals, improper integrals, sequences, series, power series, Taylor and Maclaurin series, and applications to physics and engineering.

### Prerequisites:
Calculus I (MATH 201)

### Learning Objectives:
1.  Apply various techniques of integration to solve definite and indefinite integrals.
2.  Determine the convergence or divergence of infinite sequences and series.
3.  Represent functions as power series, Taylor series, and Maclaurin series.
4.  Utilize calculus to solve real-world problems in physics, engineering, and other sciences.
5.  Evaluate improper integrals and understand their applications.
6.  Approximate functions using Taylor polynomials and estimate the error in these approximations.
