### Course Description:
This course provides a comprehensive introduction to fundamental data structures and algorithms. Students will learn to implement and analyze various data structures, including arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, and graphs. The course also covers essential algorithms for searching, sorting, and graph traversal. Emphasis will be placed on understanding the time and space complexity of different data structures and algorithms, and on selecting the most appropriate data structure for a given problem. Practical programming assignments will reinforce theoretical concepts and develop problem-solving skills.

### Prerequisites:
