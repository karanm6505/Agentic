### Course Description:
This course provides a comprehensive introduction to computer networks, focusing on the underlying principles, architectures, and protocols that govern modern network communication. Students will explore the layered network model, various protocols at each layer, routing algorithms, and essential network security concepts. Through lectures, hands-on labs, and programming projects, students will gain practical experience in network design, implementation, and analysis.

### Prerequisites:
Data Structures, Basic Probability and Statistics

### Learning Objectives:
1.  Analyze the layered architecture of computer networks and the functions of each layer.
2.  Implement and evaluate various network protocols, including TCP, UDP, and IP.
3.  Design and configure network routing algorithms.
4.  Apply network security principles to protect network infrastructure and data.
5.  Troubleshoot common network problems using network analysis tools.
6.  Evaluate the performance of different network technologies and protocols.
