### Course Description:
This course provides a comprehensive introduction to the fundamental principles and practices of software engineering. Students will learn about various software development methodologies, including Agile and Waterfall, and gain practical experience in requirements engineering, software design, implementation, testing, and project management. The course emphasizes teamwork, communication, and the application of engineering principles to build high-quality software systems. Students will work on a semester-long group project to apply the concepts learned in class.

### Prerequisites:
CS201 (Data Structures and Algorithms)

### Learning Objectives:
1.  Analyze software requirements and create specifications using various techniques.
2.  Apply different software development methodologies, such as Agile and Waterfall, to manage software projects.
3.  Design software systems using established design patterns and architectural styles.
4.  Implement software solutions using best practices for coding and documentation.
5.  Develop and execute comprehensive software testing strategies.
6.  Manage software projects effectively, considering time, cost, and quality constraints.
