### Course Description:
This course provides a comprehensive introduction to database systems, covering fundamental concepts such as database models, relational algebra, SQL, database design principles, and transaction management. Students will learn how to design, implement, and query databases, as well as understand the underlying principles that ensure data integrity and consistency. The course emphasizes hands-on experience through programming projects and practical exercises.

### Prerequisites:
Data Structures (CS201), Discrete Mathematics (MA101)

### Learning Objectives:
1.  Explain the fundamental concepts of database systems and their applications.
2.  Design relational database schemas using normalization techniques.
3.  Implement and query databases using SQL.
4.  Apply relational algebra to manipulate and retrieve data.
5.  Analyze and implement transaction management techniques for concurrency control and recovery.
6.  Evaluate different database models and their suitability for specific applications.
