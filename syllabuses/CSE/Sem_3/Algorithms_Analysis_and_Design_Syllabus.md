### Course Description:
This course provides a comprehensive introduction to the design and analysis of computer algorithms. Students will learn fundamental algorithm design techniques, including greedy algorithms, dynamic programming, and divide-and-conquer strategies. The course also covers methods for analyzing the time and space complexity of algorithms, as well as an introduction to NP-completeness. Through problem sets and exams, students will develop the skills necessary to design efficient algorithms for solving real-world problems.

### Prerequisites:
Data Structures, Discrete Mathematics

### Learning Objectives:
1.  Analyze the time and space complexity of algorithms using asymptotic notation.
2.  Design efficient algorithms using greedy, dynamic programming, and divide-and-conquer techniques.
3.  Apply appropriate data structures to improve algorithm performance.
4.  Prove the correctness of algorithms.
5.  Understand the concept of NP-completeness and its implications.
6.  Identify and solve classic algorithmic problems.
