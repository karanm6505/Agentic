### Course Description:
This course provides a comprehensive introduction to the fundamental concepts underlying modern operating systems. Topics include process management (concurrency, synchronization, scheduling), memory management (virtual memory, paging, segmentation), file systems (organization, access methods, storage management), and I/O systems (device drivers, interrupt handling). The course emphasizes both theoretical understanding and practical experience through programming projects that involve implementing key operating system components.

### Prerequisites:
Data Structures, Computer Architecture

### Learning Objectives:
1.  Explain the fundamental concepts and structures of operating systems.
2.  Implement process management techniques, including process creation, synchronization, and scheduling.
3.  Analyze different memory management strategies, such as virtual memory, paging, and segmentation.
4.  Design and implement file system structures and algorithms.
5.  Describe the architecture and functions of I/O systems.
6.  Evaluate the performance of different operating system algorithms and data structures.
