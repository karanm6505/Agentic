### Course Description:
This course provides a comprehensive introduction to statistical modeling techniques used for prediction and inference. Students will learn the theoretical foundations of various models, including linear regression, generalized linear models, and mixed-effects models. Emphasis will be placed on model building, diagnostics, and interpretation of results. The course will also cover model selection and validation techniques to ensure robust and reliable predictions. Students will gain practical experience through hands-on projects and real-world case studies.

### Prerequisites:
Introductory Statistics, Calculus I

### Learning Objectives:
1.  Formulate statistical models for a variety of data types and research questions.
2.  Implement and interpret linear regression models, including diagnostics and remedial measures.
3.  Apply generalized linear models for non-normal response variables, such as binary and count data.
4.  Evaluate and compare different statistical models using appropriate model selection criteria.
5.  Communicate statistical findings effectively through written reports and presentations.
6.  Utilize statistical software (e.g., R) to analyze data and fit statistical models.
