### Course Description:
This course provides a comprehensive introduction to the fundamental concepts and techniques of data mining. Students will learn how to preprocess data, discover association rules, build classification models, and apply clustering algorithms. Emphasis will be placed on practical applications and hands-on experience using data mining tools and programming projects. The course covers both theoretical foundations and practical implementation aspects of data mining algorithms.

### Prerequisites:
CS201 (Data Structures), STAT200 (Introduction to Statistics)

### Learning Objectives:
1.  Apply data preprocessing techniques to clean and transform raw data into a suitable format for data mining.
2.  Implement association rule mining algorithms to discover interesting relationships and patterns in large datasets.
3.  Develop and evaluate classification models using various machine learning techniques.
4.  Apply clustering algorithms to group similar data points and identify underlying data structures.
5.  Evaluate the performance of different data mining techniques and select the most appropriate method for a given task.
6.  Communicate data mining results effectively through written reports and presentations.
