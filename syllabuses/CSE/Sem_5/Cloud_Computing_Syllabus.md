### Course Description:
This course provides a comprehensive introduction to cloud computing, covering fundamental concepts, architectures, and technologies. Students will explore various cloud service models (IaaS, PaaS, SaaS), deployment models (public, private, hybrid, community), and cloud platforms (AWS, Azure, GCP). Through hands-on projects and reports, students will gain practical experience in deploying and managing applications in the cloud. The course also addresses security, scalability, and cost optimization aspects of cloud computing.

### Prerequisites:
Introduction to Computer Networks, Operating Systems, Data Structures and Algorithms

### Learning Objectives:
1.  Explain the fundamental concepts and architectures of cloud computing.
2.  Compare and contrast different cloud service models (IaaS, PaaS, SaaS).
3.  Evaluate various cloud deployment models (public, private, hybrid, community).
4.  Implement and deploy applications on major cloud platforms (AWS, Azure, GCP).
5.  Analyze the security considerations and best practices in cloud computing.
6.  Optimize cloud resource utilization for cost-effectiveness and scalability.
