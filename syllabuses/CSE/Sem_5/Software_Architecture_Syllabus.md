### Course Description:
This course provides a comprehensive introduction to software architecture, focusing on the fundamental principles and practices for designing and evaluating large-scale software systems. Students will learn about various architectural styles, design patterns, and quality attributes that influence the structure and behavior of software. Through lectures, case studies, and hands-on assignments, students will gain practical experience in creating and analyzing software architectures.

The course emphasizes the importance of architectural design in achieving system goals such as performance, scalability, reliability, and security. Students will also learn how to communicate architectural decisions effectively through documentation and presentations. This course aims to equip students with the knowledge and skills necessary to become proficient software architects.

### Prerequisites:
Data Structures and Algorithms, Object-Oriented Programming

### Learning Objectives:
1.  Analyze and compare different architectural styles and their suitability for specific application domains.
2.  Apply design patterns to solve common architectural problems.
3.  Evaluate the quality attributes of a software architecture, such as performance, security, and scalability.
4.  Create architectural design documents that effectively communicate architectural decisions.
5.  Present and defend architectural designs to stakeholders.
6.  Understand and apply software architecture principles in team-based projects.
