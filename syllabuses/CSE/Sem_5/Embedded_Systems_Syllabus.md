### Course Description:
This course provides a comprehensive introduction to the design and implementation of embedded systems. Students will explore the fundamental concepts of embedded system architecture, including microcontrollers, memory organization, and peripheral interfaces. The course emphasizes the integration of hardware and software components, focusing on programming techniques for real-time applications. Students will gain hands-on experience through laboratory assignments and a significant embedded systems project.

The course covers topics such as embedded C programming, interrupt handling, device drivers, and real-time operating systems (RTOS). Students will learn to develop efficient and reliable embedded software, considering constraints such as power consumption and memory limitations. The course aims to equip students with the knowledge and skills necessary to design and implement embedded systems for a variety of applications.
