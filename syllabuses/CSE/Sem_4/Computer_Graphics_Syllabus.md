### Course Description:
This course provides a comprehensive introduction to the principles and practices of computer graphics. Students will learn the fundamental algorithms and techniques used to create, manipulate, and display 2D and 3D graphical objects. Topics include basic raster graphics, geometric transformations, 3D modeling, rendering techniques, and animation principles. Emphasis is placed on hands-on programming projects to reinforce theoretical concepts and develop practical skills in graphics programming.

### Prerequisites:
Data Structures, Linear Algebra

### Learning Objectives:
1.  Describe the fundamental concepts and algorithms used in computer graphics.
2.  Implement 2D and 3D geometric transformations using matrix algebra.
3.  Apply rasterization algorithms to draw lines, polygons, and circles.
4.  Develop 3D models using various modeling techniques.
5.  Implement basic rendering techniques, including shading and texturing.
6.  Create simple animations using keyframing and procedural methods.
