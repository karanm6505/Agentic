# Summary of Dependency Graph Improvements Made

## Visual Enhancements:
1. **Better Layout**: Changed from left-to-right (LR) to top-to-bottom (TB) for better semester flow
2. **Color Coding**: Added color-coded categories for different types of subjects:
   - Light blue for Mathematics courses
   - Light green for Programming courses  
   - Light red for AI/ML courses
   - Light yellow for Theoretical courses
   - Light purple for Projects
   - Light gray for Electives (with dashed border)

3. **Enhanced Styling**:
   - Higher resolution (300 DPI) 
   - Orthogonal edge routing for cleaner lines
   - Better spacing between nodes and ranks
   - Rounded rectangular nodes with improved margins
   - Professional font styling (Arial)

4. **Legend**: Added a visual legend showing the color coding for different subject categories

5. **Name Shortening**: Long subject names are abbreviated for better readability:
   - "Introduction to Programming" → "Intro to Programming"
   - "Machine Learning Fundamentals" → "ML Fundamentals" 
   - "Data Structures and Algorithms" → "DSA"
   - etc.

## Functional Improvements:
1. **Fuzzy Matching**: Added intelligent prerequisite matching to connect related subjects even with name variations
2. **Enhanced Clustering**: Better semester organization with rounded, colored clusters
3. **Improved Edge Styling**: Better arrow heads and edge colors for prerequisite relationships

## Usage:
- Generate PNG: `python3 generate_dependency_graph.py my_aiml_subjects.yaml --format png`
- Generate SVG (better quality): `python3 generate_dependency_graph.py my_aiml_subjects.yaml --format svg`
- Generate PDF: `python3 generate_dependency_graph.py my_aiml_subjects.yaml --format pdf`

## To Avoid API Limits:
You can add explicit prerequisites to your YAML file like this:
```yaml
- subject: "Deep Learning"
  level: "Undergraduate"
  duration_weeks: 16
  focus: "Neural networks and deep learning"
  assessments: "Projects and exams"
  prerequisites: "Machine Learning Fundamentals, Linear Algebra, Calculus II"
```

This will bypass the Gemini API calls and use your explicit prerequisites instead.
